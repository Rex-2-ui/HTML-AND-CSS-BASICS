    <p>
      Mario is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise,
       owned by Nintendo and created by Japanese video game designer
        Shigeru Miyamoto. Serving as the company's mascot and the eponymous
         protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games
          since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who
           resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center
            on rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser.
             The character is also known for his jumping ability and
              his catchphrase "It's-a me, Mario!"
