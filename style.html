  The science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting and
  presenting data for the purpose
   of assisting in making a more effective decision is called statistics.
   Statistics as a subject may
   therefore be regarded as the study of “making sense of data’’.
There are two other meanings of statistics. One meaning  refers to
data collected on characteristics of items or objects as statistics.
For example, motor accident statistics, which gives a record on a
number of vehicles involved in motor accidents – the number of casualties,
 the proportion of fatal ones, etc. - in a specified period of time.
 Another example is vital statistics, which consists of the number of
 births, deaths marriages, etc. in a community. (These days, it is also
 common to refer to the bust, waist and hip sizes of a person as vital statistics).
 Another meaning of statistics refers to a numerical description called statistic
 (without “s”). Some examples of statistics are the sample mean, sample
 standard deviation and coefficient of skewness. The meaning of the word
 is generally understood in the context in which it is used

Qualitative variables, on the other hand, cannot be measured or counted
 but can only be categorized based on the characteristics they bear.
 They are nonnumeric and can only be described or classified according
  to the characteristics which they share in common. Qualitative variable
   are either nominal or ordinal. Qualitative variables also referred to as
    categorical variables or attribute variables, specify “how many fall in
    each category” or “what proportion or percentage fall in each category?”
    Qualitative data, therefore, consist of counts or frequencies in the
    various categories.
